🛠 Tools Used
1. Python:
- Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing. We use it to load, clean, and transform the data, including handling missing values and creating new features.
- NumPy: For numerical operations, particularly in handling arrays and performing mathematical calculations like aggregating sales data.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the sales trends and forecasts over time. This helps in better understanding of the data and results.
- Statsmodels (ARIMA): For time-series forecasting. ARIMA is used to model the data and generate sales forecasts based on historical sales data.
- Scikit-learn: For calculating model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the performance of the ARIMA model.
